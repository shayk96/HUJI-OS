Answers for theoretical part:
1.	The PID namespace provides processes with an independent set of process
 IDs (PIDs) from other namespaces.
2.	The process can't see files in the file system of the operating system, it
 can only see files in it's file system.
3.	Limiting the number of process the container can create.
4.	Clone, as fork, creates a new process. Unlike fork, these calls allow
 the child process execute a different function and has a different
  namespaces from his parent.
5.	A chroot on Unix system is an operation that changes the apparent
 root directory for the current running process and its children.
6.	The proc filesystem (procfs) is a special filesystem in Unix-like
 operating systems that presents information about processes and other system.
  It contains useful information about the processes that are currently
   running, it is regarded as control and information center for kernel.
    For example, after creating new container, we will mount the ‘proc’
     directory inside the file system.
